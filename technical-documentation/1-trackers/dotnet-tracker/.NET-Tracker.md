<a name="overview" />
## 1. Overview

The [Snowplow .NET Tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-dotnet-tracker) allows you to track Snowplow events from your .NET websites and desktop applications.

The tracker should be straightforward to use if you are comfortable with C# development; any prior experience with Snowplow's [[JavaScript Tracker]], [[Python Tracker]] or [[Ruby Tracker]], Google Analytics or Mixpanel (which have similar APIs to Snowplow) is helpful but not necessary.

Note that this tracker covers all the same events as the Python and Ruby Trackers.

There are three basic types of object you will create when using the Snowplow .NET Tracker: subjects, emitters, and trackers.

A subject represents a user whose events are tracked. A tracker constructs events and sends them to one or more emitters. Each emitter then sends the event to the endpoint you configure. This will usually be a Snowplow collector, but could also be a Redis database.

<a name="init" />
## 2 Initialization

Assuming you have completed the [[.NET Tracker Setup]] for your project, you are now ready to initialize the .NET Tracker.

<a name="importing" />
### 2.1 Accessing the namespace

Add the .NET Tracker's namespace like so:

```csharp
using Snowplow.Tracker
```

That's it - you are now ready to initialize a tracker instance.

<a name="create-tracker" />
### 2.2 Creating a tracker

The simplest tracker initialization only requires you to provide the URI of the collector to which the tracker will log events:

```csharp
var e = new Emitter("d3rkrsqld9gmqf.cloudfront.net")
var t = new Tracker(e)
```

There are other optional keyword arguments:

| **Argument Name** | **Description**                      | **Required?** | **Default**          |
|-------------:|:-------------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------|
| `emitters`      | The emitter to which events are sent       | Yes           | None        |
| `subject`   | The user being tracked               |         No            | `new Subject()` |
| `namespace`  | The name of the tracker instance     |  No           |  `null` |
| `appId` | The application ID          | No           | `null`         |
| `encodeBase64` | Whether to enable [base 64 encoding] [base64] | No | `true`  |

A more complete example:

```csharp
var tracker = new Tracker(new Emitter("d3rkrsqld9gmqf.cloudfront.net"), "cf", "my-application-id", false);
```

<a name="emitter" />
#### 2.2.1 `emitters`

This can be a single emitter or a `List` of emitters. The tracker will send events to these emitters, which will in turn send them to a collector. See [Emitters](#emitters) for more on emitter configuration.

<a name="subject" />
#### 2.2.2 `subject`

The user which the Tracker will track. This should be an instance of the [Subject](#subject) class. You don't need to set this during Tracker construction; you can use the `Tracker.SetSubject` method afterwards. In fact, you don't need to create a subject at all. If you don't, though, your events won't contain user-specific data such as timezone and language.

<a name="namespace" />
#### 2.2.3 `namespace`

If provided, the `namespace` argument will be attached to every event fired by the new tracker. This allows you to later identify which tracker fired which event if you have multiple trackers running.

<a name="app-id" />
#### 2.2.4 `appId`

The `appId` argument lets you set the application ID to any string.

<a name="base64" />
#### 2.2.5 `encodeBase64`

By default, unstructured events and custom contexts are encoded into Base64 to ensure that no data is lost or corrupted. You can turn encoding on or off using the Boolean `encodeBase64` argument.

[Back to top](#top)

<a name="subject-class" />
## 3. Adding extra data: The Subject class

You may have additional information about your application's environment, current user and so on, which you want to send to Snowplow with each event.

Create a subject like this:

```csharp
var s = new Subject();
```

The Subject class has a set of `set...()` methods to attach extra data relating to the user to all tracked events:

* [`SetPlatform`](#set-platform)
* [`SetUserId`](#set-user-id)
* [`SetScreenResolution`](#set-screen-resolution)
* [`SetViewport`](#set-viewport)
* [`SetColorDepth`](#set-color-depth)
* [`SetTimezone`](#set-timezone)
* [`SetLang`](#set-lang)

All of these methods return the Subject instance.

If you initialize a `Tracker` instance without a subject, a default `Subject` instance will be attached to the tracker. You can access that subject by calling the relevant method on the `Tracker` instance:

```csharp
t = new Tracker(myEmitter);
t.subject.SetPlatform(Platform.Pc).SetUserId("user-12345").SetLang("en");
```

We will discuss each of these in turn below:

<a name="set-platform" />
#### 3.1 Change the tracker's platform with `SetPlatform`

The possible platforms are enumerated in the `Platform` enum. The default platform is `Platform.Pc`. You can change the platform the subject is using by calling:

```csharp
s.SetPlatform( {{PLATFORM}} );
```

For example:

```csharp
s.SetPlatform(Platform.Srv) // Running on a server
```

For a full list of supported platforms, please see the [[Snowplow Tracker Protocol]].

[Back to top](#top)

<a name="set-user-id" />
### 3.2 Set user ID with `SetUserId`

You can set the user ID to any string:

```csharp
s.SetUserId( "{{USER ID}}" );
```

Example:

```csharp
s.SetUserId("alexd");
```

[Back to top](#top)

<a name="set-screen-resolution" />
### 3.3 Set screen resolution with `SetScreenResolution`

If your code has access to the device's screen resolution, then you can pass this in to Snowplow too:

```csharp
s.SetScreenResolution( {{WIDTH}}, {{HEIGHT}} );
```

Both numbers should be positive integers; note the order is width followed by height. Example:

```csharp
s.SetScreenResolution(1366, 768);
```

[Back to top](#top)

<a name="set-viewport-dimensions" />
### 3.4 Set viewport dimensions with `SetViewport`

If your code has access to the viewport dimensions, then you can pass this in to Snowplow too:

```csharp
s.SetViewport( {{WIDTH}}, {{HEIGHT}} );
```

Both numbers should be positive integers; note the order is width followed by height. Example:

```csharp
s.SetViewport(300, 200);
```

[Back to top](#top)

<a name="set-color-depth" />
### 3.5 Set color depth with `SetColorDepth`

If your code has access to the bit depth of the device's color palette for displaying images, then you can pass this in to Snowplow too:

```csharp
s.SetColorDepth( {{BITS PER PIXEL}} );
```

The number should be a positive integer, in bits per pixel. Example:

```csharp
s.SetColorDepth(32);
```

[Back to top](#top)

<a name="set-timezone" />
### 3.6 Set timezone with `SetTimezone`

This method lets you pass a user's timezone in to Snowplow:

```csharp
s.timezone( {{TIMEZONE}} );
```

The timezone should be a string:

```csharp
s.SetColorDepth("Europe/London");
```

[Back to top](#top)

<a name="set-lang" />
### 3.7 Set the language with `SetLang`

This method lets you pass a user's language in to Snowplow:

```csharp
s.SetLang( {{LANGUAGE}} );
```

The language should be a string:

```csharp
s.SetLang('en');
```

<a name="multiple-subjects" />
### 3.7 Tracking multiple subjects

You may want to track more than one subject concurrently. To avoid data about one subject being added to events pertaining to another subject, create two subject instances and switch between them using `Tracker.SetSubject`:

```csharp
# Create a simple Emitter which will log events to http://d3rkrsqld9gmqf.cloudfront.net/i
var e = new Emitter("d3rkrsqld9gmqf.cloudfront.net");

# Create a Tracker instance
var t = new Tracker(emitters=e, namespace="cf", appId="CF63A");

# Create a Subject corresponding to a pc user
var s1 = new Subject();

# Set some data for that user
s1.SetPlatform(Platform.Pc);
s1.SetUserId("0a78f2867de");

# Set s1 as the tracker subject
# All events fired will have the information we set about s1 attached
t.SetSubject(s1);

# Track user s1 viewing a page
t.TrackPageView("http://www.example.com");

# Create another Subject instance corresponding to a mobile user
var s2 = new Subject();

# All methods of the Subject class return the Subject instance so methods can be chained:
s2.SetPlatform(Platform.Web).SetUserId("0b08f8be3f1");

# Change the tracker subject from s1 to s2
# All events fired will have instead have information we set about s2 attached
t.SetSubject(s2);

# Track user s2 viewing a page
t.TrackPageView("http://www.example.com");

# Switch back to s1 and track a structured event, this time using method chaining:
t.SetSubject(s1).TrackStructEvent("Ecomm", "add-to-basket", "dog-skateboarding-video", "hd", 13.99);
```

<a name="events" />
## 4. Tracking specific events

Snowplow has been built to enable you to track a wide range of events that occur when users interact with your websites and apps. We are constantly growing the range of functions available in order to capture that data more richly.

Tracking methods supported by the .NET Tracker at a glance:

| **Function**                                  | **Description**                                        |
|----------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| [`TrackPageView()`](#page-view)             | Track and record views of web pages.                   |
| [`TrackEcommerceTransaction()`](#ecommerce-transaction)   | Track an ecommerce transaction           |
| [`TrackScreenView()`](#screen-view)         | Track the user viewing a screen within the application |
| [`TrackStructEvent()`](#struct-event)       | Track a Snowplow custom structured event               |
| [`TrackUnstructEvent()`](#unstruct-event)   | Track a Snowplow custom unstructured event             |

<a name="common" />
### 4.1 Common

All events are tracked with specific methods on the tracker instance, of the form `TrackXXX()`, where `XXX` is the name of the event to track.

<a name="custom-contexts" />
### 4.1.1 Custom contexts

In short, custom contexts let you add additional information about the circumstances surrounding an event in the form of a C# dictionary object. Each tracking method accepts an additional optional contexts parameter after all the parameters specific to that method, which should be a list of contexts:

```csharp
public Tracker TrackPageView(string pageUrl, string pageTitle = null, string referrer = null, 
                             List<Dictionary<String, Object>> context = null, Int64? tstamp = null)
```

The `context` argument should consist of a List<Dictionary<String, Object>>. The format of each dictionary is the same as for an [unstructured event](#unstruct-event).

If a visitor arrives on a page advertising a movie, the dictionary for a single custom context in the list might look like this:


```csharp
var movieContext = new List<Dictionary<String, Object>>
{ 
  { "schema", "iglu:com.acme_company/movie_poster/jsonschema/2.1.1" },
  { "data", new Dictionary<String, Object> 
  {
    { "movie_name", "Solaris" }, 
    { "poster_country": "JP" }
  }
  }
};
```

This is how to fire a page view event with the above custom context:

```csharp
t.TrackPageView("http://www.films.com", "Homepage", null, new List<Dictionary<String, String>> {movieContext});
```

Note that even though there is only one custom context attached to the event, it still needs to be placed in an array.

<a name="tstamp-arg" />
### 4.1.2 Optional timestamp argument

Each `Track...()` method supports an optional timestamp as its final argument; this allows you to manually override the timestamp attached to this event. The timestamp should be in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

If you do not pass this timestamp in as an argument, then the .NET Tracker will use the current time to be the timestamp for the event.

Here is an example tracking a structured event and supplying the optional timestamp argument. We can explicitly supply `None`s for the intervening arguments which are empty:

```csharp
t.TrackStructEvent("some cat", "save action", None, None, None, 1368725287000)
```

Timestamp is counted in milliseconds since the Unix epoch - the same format as generated by:

```csharp
Int64 tstamp = (Int64)(DateTime.UtcNow.Subtract(new DateTime(1970, 1, 1))).TotalMilliseconds;
```

<a name="return-values" />
### 4.1.3 Tracker method return values

All tracker methods will return the tracker instance, allowing tracker methods to be chained:

```csharp
var e = new AsyncEmitter("d3rkrsqld9gmqf.cloudfront.net");
var t = new Tracker(e);

t.TrackPageView("http://www.example.com").TrackScreenView("title screen");
```

[Back to top](#top)

<a name="screen-view" />
### 4.2 Track screen views with `TrackScreenView()`

Use `TrackScreenView()` to track a user viewing a screen (or equivalent) within your app. Arguments are:

| **Argument** | **Description**                     | **Required?** | **Type**                |
|-------------:|:------------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------|
| `name`       | Human-readable name for this screen | No            | String        |
| `id`         | Unique identifier for this screen   | No            | String                  |
| `context`    | Custom context for the event        | No            | List<Dictionary<String, object>>> |
| `tstamp`     | When the screen was viewed          | No            | Int64        |

Although name and id are not individually required, at least one must be provided or the event will fail validation.

Example:

```csharp
t.TrackScreenView("HUD > Save Game", "screen23", null, 1368725287000)
```

[Back to top](#top)

<a name="page-view" />
### 4.3 Track pageviews with `TrackPageView()`

Use `TrackPageView()` to track a user viewing a page within your app.
Arguments are:

| **Argument** | **Description**                     | **Required?** | **Validation**          |
|-------------:|:------------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------|
| `pageUrl`   | The URL of the page                 | Yes           | String                  |
| `pageTitle` | The title of the page               | No            | String                  |
| `referrer`   | The address which linked to the page| No            | String                  |
| `context`    | Custom context for the event        | No            | List<Dictionary<String, Object>>> |
| `tstamp`     | When the pageview occurred          | No            | Int64                   |

Example:

```csharp
t.TrackPageView("www.example.com", "example", "www.referrer.com")
```

[Back to top](#top)

<a name="ecommerce-transaction" />
### 4.4 Track ecommerce transactions with `track-ecommerce-transaction()`

Use `TrackEcommerceTransaction()` to track an ecommerce transaction.
Arguments:

| **Argument**     | **Description**                   | **Required?** | **Validation**    |
|-----------------:|:----------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------|
| `orderId`    | ID of the eCommerce transaction      | Yes           | String            |
| `totalValuee` | Total transaction value              | Yes           | Double            |
| `affiliation` | Transaction affiliation              | No            | String            |
| `taxValue`   | Transaction tax value                | No            | Double            |
| `shipping`    | Delivery cost charged                | No            | Double            |
| `city`        | Delivery address city                | No            | String            |
| `state`       | Delivery address state               | No            | String            |
| `country`     | Delivery address country             | No            | String            | 
| `currency     | Transaction currency                 | No            | String            |
| `items`       | Items in the transaction             | Yes           | List<TransactionItem> |
| `context`     | Custom context for the event         | No            | List<Dictionary<String, Object>>> |
| `tstamp`      | When the transaction event occurred  | No            | Int64             |

The `items` argument is a List of TransactionItems. `TrackEcommerceTransaction` fires multiple events: one transaction event for the transaction as a whole, and one transaction item event for each element of the `items` list. Each transaction item event will have the same timestamp, order ID, and currency as the main transaction event.

These are the fields with which a TransactionItem can be created.

| **Field**       | **Description**                     | **Required?** | **Validation**           |
|----------------:|:------------------------------------|:--------------|:-------------------------|
| `"sku"`         | Item SKU                            | Yes           | String                   |
| `"price"`       | Item price                          | Yes           | Double                   |
| `"quantity"`    | Item quantity                       | Yes           | Int                      |
| `"name"`        | Item name                           | No            | String                   |
| `"category"`    | Item category                       | No            | String                   |
| `"context"`     | Custom context for the event        | No            | List<Dictionary<String, Object>>> |

Example of tracking a transaction containing two items:

```csharp
var items = new List<TransactionItem>
{
	new TransactionItem("pbz0026", 20, 1),
	new TransactionItem("pbz0038", 15, 1, "red hat", "menswear")
};
t.TrackEcommerceTransaction("6a8078be", 35, "some-affiliation", 6.125, 0, "London", null, "UK", currency="GBP", items);
```

<a name="struct-event" />
### 4.6 Track structured events with `TrackStructEvent()`

Use `TrackStructEvent()` to track a custom event happening in your app which fits the Google Analytics-style structure of having up to five fields (with only the first two required):

| **Argument** | **Description**                                                  | **Required?** | **Validation**           |
|-------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------  |:--------------|:-------------------------|
| `category`   | The grouping of structured events which this `action` belongs to | Yes           | Non-empty string         |
| `action`     | Defines the type of user interaction which this event involves   | Yes           | Non-empty string         |
| `label`      | A string to provide additional dimensions to the event data      | No            | String                   |
| `property`   | A string describing the object or the action performed on it     | No            | String                   |
| `value`      | A value to provide numerical data about the event                | No            | Int or Float             |
| `context`    | Custom context for the event                                     | No            | List<Dictionary<String, Object>>> |
| `tstamp`     | When the structured event occurred                               | No            | Int64         |

Example:

```csharp
t.TrackStructEvent("shop", "add-to-basket", None, "pcs", 2);
```

[Back to top](#top)

<a name="unstruct-event" />
### 4.7 Track unstructured events with `TrackUnstructEvent()`

Use `TrackUnstructEvent()` to track a custom event which consists of a name and an unstructured set of properties. This is useful when:

* You want to track event types which are proprietary/specific to your business (i.e. not already part of Snowplow), or
* You want to track events which have unpredictable or frequently changing properties

The arguments are as follows:

| **Argument**   | **Description**                      | **Required?** | **Validation**          |
|---------------:|:-------------------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------|
| `eventJson`    | The properties of the event          | Yes           | <Dictionary<String, Object >>      |
| `context`      | Custom context for the event         | No            | List<Dictionary<String, Object>>> |
| `tstamp`       | When the unstructured event occurred | No            | Int64        |

Example:

```csharp
var eventData = new Dictionary<String, Object>
{
	{ "level", 5 },
	{ "saveId", "ju302" },
	{ "hardMode", true }
};
var eventJson = new Dictionary<String, Object>
{
	{ "schema", "com.example_company/save-game/jsonschema/1.0.2" },
	{ "data", eventData },
};
t.TrackUnstructEvent(eventJson);
```

The `eventJson` must be a Dictionary<String, Object> with two fields: `schema` and `data`. `data` is a flat dictionary containing the properties of the unstructured event. `schema` identifies the JSON schema against which `data` should be validated.

For more on JSON schema, see the [blog post] [self-describing-jsons].

<a name="emitter" />
## 5. Emitters

Tracker instances must be initialized with an emitter. This section will go into more depth about the Emitter class and its subclasses.

<a name="base-emitter" />
## 5.1 The basic Emitter class

At its most basic, the Emitter class only needs a collector URI:

```csharp
var e = new Emitter("d3rkrsqld9gmqf.cloudfront.net");
```

This is the signature of the constructor for the base Emitter class:

```csharp
public Emitter(string endpoint, 
             HttpProtocol protocol = HttpProtocol.HTTP, int? port = null, HttpMethod = HttpMethod.GET, 
             int? bufferSize = null, Action<Int> onSuccess = null, Action<Int, List<Dictionary<String, String>>> onFailure = null):
```

| **Argument**   | **Description**                      | **Required?** |
|---------------:|:-------------------------------------|:--------------|
| `endpoint`     | The collector URI                    | Yes           |
| `protocol`     | Request protocol: HTTP or HTTPS      | No            |
| `port`         | The port to connect to               | No            |
| `method`       | The method to use: "get" or "post"       | No        |
| `bufferSize`  | Number of events to store before flushing | No       |
| `onSuccess`   | Callback executed when a flush is successful | No    |
| `onFailure`   | Callback executed when a flush is unsuccessful | No  |

`protocol` must be a member of the `HttpProtocol` enum: `HttpProtocol.HTTP` or `HttpProtocol.HTTPS`.
`method` must be a member of the `HttpMethod` enum: `HttpMethod.GET` or `HttpMethod.POST`.

When the emitter receives an event, it adds it to a buffer. When the queue is full, all events in the queue get sent to the collector. The `bufferSize` argument allows you to customize the queue size. By default, it is 1 for GET requests and 10 for POST requests. (So in the case of GET requests, each event is fired as soon as the emitter receives it.) If the emitter is configured to send POST requests, then instead of sending one for every event in the buffer, it will send a sing request containing all those events in JSON format.

*Warning: `method` defaults to GET because Snowplow collectors do not currently support POST requests.*

`onSuccess` is an optional callback that will execute whenever the queue is flushed successfully, that is, whenever every request sent has status code 200. It will be passed one argument: the number of events that were sent.

`onFailure` is similar, but executes when the flush is not wholly successful. It will be passed two arguments: the number of events that were successfully sent, and a list of unsent requests.

An example:

```csharp
unsentEvents = new List<Dictionary<String, String>>();

Action<Int> successCallback = (successCount) => 
{
	Console.WriteLine(String.Format("{0} events sent successfully!", successCount.ToString()));
};

Action<Int, List<Dictionary<String, String>>> failureCallback = (successCount, unsentEvents) => 
{
	Console.WriteLine(String.Format("{0} events sent successfully!", successCount.ToString()));
	Console.WriteLine(String.Format("Failed to send {0} events", unsentEvents.Count.ToString()));
	foreach (event e in unsentEvents)
	{
		unsentEvents.Add(e);
	}
};

// Initialize an emitter with a bufferSize of 2 and with onSuccess and onFailure callbacks
var e = new Emitter("d3rkrsqld9gmqf.cloudfront.net", HttpProtocol.HTTP, null, HttpMethod.GET, 2, successCallback, failureCallback);

var t = new Tracker(e);

// This doesn't cause the emitter to send a request because the bufferSize was set to 3, not 1
t.TrackPageView("http://www.example.com");
t.TrackPageView("http://www.example.com/page1");

// This does cause the emitter to try to send all 3 events
t.TrackPageView("http://www.example.com/page2");

// Since the method is GET by default, 3 separate requests are sent
// If any of them are unsuccessful, they will be stored in the unsentEvents variable
```

## 5.2 The AsyncEmitter class

```csharp
var e = new AsyncEmitter("d3rkrsqld9gmqf.cloudfront.net");
```

The `AsyncEmitter` class works just like the Emitter class. It has one advantage, though: HTTP(S) requests are sent asynchronously, using C# Tasks, so the Tracker won't be blocked while the Emitter waits for a response. For this reason, the AsyncEmitter is recommended over the base `Emitter` class.

<a name="manual-flushing" />
### 5.3 Manual flushing

You can flush the emitter manually using the `Flush` method of the `Tracker` instance which is sending events to the emitter. If you pass it the Boolean value `true`, it will be a blocking call which synchronously sends all events in the emitter's buffer. In the case of the `AsyncEmitter`, it also forces all running tasks to finish within 10 seconds.

```csharp
t.Flush(true);
```

<a name="multiple-emitters" />
### 5.4 Multiple emitters

You can configure a tracker instance to send events to multiple emitters by passing the `Tracker` constructor function an array of emitters instead of a single emitter, or by using the `addEmitter` method:

```csharp
var e1 = new AsyncEmitter("collector1.cloudfront.net", HttpProtocol.HTTP, null, HttpMethod.GET);
var e1 = new AsyncEmitter("collector2.cloudfront.net", HttpProtocol.HTTP, null, HttpMethod.POST);
var e3 = new Emitter("collector2.cloudfront.net", HttpProtocol.HTTPS, null, HttpMethod.POST);

var t = new Tracker([e1, e2]);

t.addEmitter(e3);
```

<a name="custom-emitters" />
### 5.5 Custom emitters

You can create your own custom emitter class, implementing the IEmitter interface. This means it must have the following methods:

```csharp
void Flush(bool sync);

void Input(Dictionary<String, String> payload);
```

The `Input` method is called whenever the Tracker instance gives the Emitter a dictionary of name-value pairs representing one event.

The `Flush` method is called be the Tracker's `Flush` method. It need not do anything.

<a name="logging" />
## 6. Logging

The emitters.rb module has Python logging enabled to give you information about requests being sent. The logger prints to the console messages about what emitters are doing. By default, only messages with priority "INFO" or higher will be logged.

To change this, use the static `SetLogLevel` method of the `Emitter` class:

```csharp
Emitter.SetLogLevel(Logging.Debug);
```

The levels are:

| **Level**      | **Description** |
|---------------:|:----------------|
| `Off`    | Nothing logged     |
| `Warn`   | Notification for requests with status code not equal to 200  |
| `Info`   | Notification for all requests |
| `Debug`  | Contents of all requests     |
