## Overview

SnowPlow has been designed to make it as easy as possible for analysts to use whatever analysis tools they want to crunch SnowPlow data.

As a result, documenting how to employ all the different possible tools to perform that analysis with SnowPlow is a huge project in itself. We are just making a start now!

For more information on analytics with SnowPlow, see the [Analytics Cookbook](http://snowplowanalytics.com/analytics/index.html) on the [SnowPlow website](http://snowplowanalytics.com).
