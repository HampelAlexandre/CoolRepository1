## An overview of how the RDB Loader instruments the loading of data from S3 into Redshift

[[/technical-documentation/images/storage-loader-steps.png]]

* Data from enriched Snowplow event files generated by the Spark process on EMR is read and written to Amazon Redshift
* The enriched event files are then moved from the in-bucket (which *was* the archive bucket for the EmrEtlRunner) to the archive bucket (for the StorageLoader)

The RDB Loader is configured via the [configuration file][config-file] and [storage targets configs][] shared with [[EmrEtlRunner]]
For more information, see the guide to [setting up the StorageLoader][storage-loader-setup].

## The RDB Loader role in ETL process

The enriched files contain the tab-separated values contributing to `atomic.events` and custom tables. The [shredding process](Shredding)

1. reads Snowplow enriched events from enriched good files (produced and temporary stored in HDFS as a result of [enrichment process](The-enrichment-process));
2. extracts any unstructured (self-describing) event JSONs and contexts JSONs found;
3. validates that these JSONs conform to the corresponding schemas located in [Iglu registry](Iglu-registry);
4. adds metadata to these JSONs to track their origins;
5. writes these JSONs out to nested folders on S3 dependent on their schema.

As a result the **enriched good** file is "shredded" into a few **shredded good** files (provided the event file contained data from at least one of the following: [custom self-describing events](Custom-events#unstructured-event), [contexts](Contexts-overview), [configurable enrichments](configurable-enrichments)):

1. a TSV formatted file containing the data for `atomic.events` table;
2. possibly one or more JSON files related to custom user specific (self-describing) events extracted from `unstruct_event` field of the enriched good file;
3. possibly one or more JSON files related to custom contexts extracted from `contexts` filed of the enriched good file;
4. possibly one or more JSON files related to configurable enrichments (if any was enabled) extracted from `derived_contexts` field of the enriched good file.

Those files end up in S3 and are used to load the data into Redshift tables dedicated to each of the above files under the StorageLoader orchestration.

The whole process could be depicted with the following dataflow diagram.
