## 1. Overview

In order to analyse Snowplow data, it is important to understand how it is structured. We have tried to make the structure of Snowplow data as simple, logical, and easy-to-query as possible.

* **Each line represents one event**. Each line in the Snowplow events table represents a single *event*, be that a *page view*, *add to basket*, *play video*, *like* etc.
* **Structured data**. Snowplow data is structured: individual fields are stored in their own columns, making writing sophisticated queries on the data easy, and making it straightforward for analysts to plugin any kind of analysis tool into their Snowplow data to compose and execute queries
* **Extensible schema**. Snowplow started life as a web analytics data warehousing platform, and has a basic schema suitable for performing web analytics, with a wide range of web-specific dimensions (related to page URLs, browsers, operating systems, devices, IP addresses, cookie IDs) and web-specfic events (page views, page pings, transactions). All of these fields can be found in the `atomic.events` table, which is a "fat" (many columns) table. As Snowplow has evolved into a general purpose event analytics platform, we've enabled Snowplow users to define additional event types (we call these *custom unstructured events*) and define their own entities (we call these *custom contexts*) so that they can extend the schema to suit their own businesses. For Snowplow users running Amazon Redshift, each custom unstructured event and custom context will be stored in its own dedicated table, again with one line per event. These additional tables can be joined back to the core `atomic.events` table, by joining on the `root_id` field in the custom unstructured event / custom context table with the `event_id` in the `atomic.events` table
* **Single table**. All the events are effectively stored in a single table, making running queries across the data very easy. Even if you're running Snowplow with Redshift and have extended the schema as described above, you can still query the data as if it were in a single fat table. This is because:
  * The joins from the additional tables to the core `atomic.events` table are one-to-one
  * The field joined on is the distribution and sort key for both tables, so queries are as fast as if the data were in a single table
* **Immutable log**. The Snowplow data table is designed to be immutable: the data in each line should not change over time. Data points that we would expect to change over time (e.g. what cohort a particular user belongs to, how we classify a particular visitor) can be derived from Snowplow data. However, our recommendation is that these derived fields should be defined and calculated at analysis time, stored in a separate table and joined to the *Snowplow events table* when performing any analysis

### 2.1 Common fields (platform and event independent)

<a name="application" />
#### 2.1.1 Application fields

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `app_id`        | text     | Application ID  | Yes       | Yes       | 'angry-birds'  |
| `platform`      | text     | Platform        | Yes       | Yes       | 'web'          |    

The application ID is used to distinguish different applications that are being tracked by the same Snowplow stack.

The platform ID is used to distinguish the same app running on different platforms e.g. `iOS` vs `web`.

#### 2.1.4 Snowplow version fields

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `v_tracker`     | text     | Tracker version | Yes       | Yes       | 'no-js-0.1.0'  |
| `v_collector`   | text     | Collector version | Yes     | Yes       | 'clj-tomcat-0.1.0', 'cf' |

<a name="user" />
#### 2.1.5 User-related fields

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `user_id`       | text     | Unique ID set by business | No | Yes | 'jon.doe@email.com' |
| `domain_userid` | text     | User ID set by Snowplow using 1st party cookie | No | Yes | 'bc2e92ec6c204a14' |
| `network_userid`| text     | User ID set by Snowplow using 3rd party cookie | No | Yes | 'ecdff4d0-9175-40ac-a8bb-325c49733607' |
| `user_ipaddress` | text    | Ueser IP address | No       | Yes       | '92.231.54.234' |
| `domain_sessionidx` | int      | A visit / session index | No | Yes | 3              |
| `domain_sessionid`  | text      | A visit / session identifier | No | Yes | 'c6ef3124-b53a-4b13-a233-0088f79dcbcb'              |

`domain_sessionidx` is the number of the current user session. For example, an event occurring during a user's first session would have `domain_sessionidx` set to 1. The JavaScript Tracker calculates this field by storing a visit count in a first-party cookie. Whenever the Tracker fires an event, if more than 30 minutes have elapsed since the last event, the visitor count is increased by 1. (Whenever an event is fired, a "session cookie" is created and set to expire in 30 minutes. This is how the Tracker can tell whether the visit count should be incremented.) Thirty minutes is the default value and can be changed using the `setSessionCookieTimeout` method.

### 2.3 Event-specific fields

Snowplow includes specific fields to capture data associated with specific events.

Note that to date, all event types have been defined by Snowplow. Also note that `event_vendor` values follow the [Java package naming convention](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html).

Snowplow currently supports (or will support in the near future) the following event types:

|        | **Event type**                                              | **Value of `event` field in model**    |
|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| 2.3.1  | [Page views](#pageview)                                     | 'page_view'                            |
| 2.3.2  | [Page pings](#pageping)                                     | 'page_ping'                            |
| 2.3.3  | [Ecommerce transactions](#ecomm)                            | 'transaction' and 'transaction_item'   |
| 2.3.4  | [Errors](#error)                                            | 'error'                                |
| 2.3.5  | [Custom structured events](#customstruct)                   | 'struct'                               |
| 2.3.6  | [Custom unstructured events](#customunstruct)               | 'unstruct'                             |

Details of which fields are available for which events are given below:

<a name="pageview" />
#### 2.3.1 Page views

There are currently no fields that are specific to `page_view` events: all the fields that are required are part of the standard fields available for any [web-based event](#web) e.g. `page_urlscheme`, `page_title`.

Back to [top](#top).

<a name="pagepings" />
#### 2.3.2 Page pings

There are four additional fields included with page pings that indicate how a user has scrolled over a web page since the last page ping:

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `pp_xoffset_min`| integer  | Minimum page x offset seen in the last ping period | No | Yes | 0 | 
| `pp_xoffset_max`| integer  | Maximum page x offset seen in the last ping period | No | Yes | 100 | 
| `pp_yoffset_min`| integer  | Minimum page y offset seen in the last ping period | No | Yes | 0 | 
| `pp_yoffset_max`| integer  | Maximum page y offset seen in the last ping period | No | Yes | 200 | 

Back to [top](#top).

<a name="ecomm" />
#### 2.3.3 Ecommerce transactions

There are a large number of fields specifically for transaction events.

Fields that start `tr_` relate to the transaction as a whole. Fields that start `ti_` refer to the specific item included in the transaction. (E.g. a product in the basket.) Single transactions typically span multiple lines of data: there will be a single line where `event` = `transaction`, where the `tr_` fields are set, and multiple lines (one for each product included) where `event` = `transaction_item` and the `ti_` fields are set.

#### 2.3.5 Custom structured events

If you wish to track an event that Snowplow does not recognise as a first class citizen (i.e. one of the events listed above), then you can track them using the generic 'custom structured events'. Currently there are five fields that are available to store data related to custom events: we plant to increase this to 25 in the near future:

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `se_category`   | text     | Category of event | Yes     | Yes       | 'ecomm', 'video' |
| `se_action`     | text     | Action performed / event name | Yes | Yes | 'add-to-basket', 'play-video' |
| `se_label`      | text     | The object of the action e.g. the ID of the video played or SKU of the product added-to-basket | No | Yes | 'pbz00123' |
| `se_property`   | text     | A property associated with the object of the action | No | Yes | 'HD', 'large' |
| `se_value`      | decimal  | A value associated with the event / action e.g. the value of goods added-to-basket | No | Yes | 9.99 |

#### 2.3.6 Custom unstructured events

Custom unstructured events are a flexible tool that enable Snowplow users to define their own event types and send them into Snowplow.

When a user sends in a custom unstructured event, they do so as a JSON of name-value properties, that conforms to a JSON schema defined for the event earlier. 

The complete JSON envelop for the event is loaded into the `atomic.events` table, in the `unstruct_event` field as shown below:

| **Field**        | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:-----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `unstruct_event` | JSON     | Name of the event | Yes     | Yes       | {"schema":"iglu:com.mycompany/product_view/jsonschema/1-0-1", "data":{"sku":"14424"}} |

In addition, for Snowplow users running Redshift, the unstructured event is shredded into its own table in Amazon Redshift. The fields in this table will be determined by the JSON schema defined for the event in advance. Users can query just the table for that particular unstructured event, if that's all that's required for their analysis, or join that table back to the `atomic.events` table by `atomic.my_example_unstructured_event_table.root_id = atomic.events.root_id`.

## 3. A note about storage data formats

* Currently, Snowplow data is stored in S3 (for processing in Apache Hive, Pig, and / or Mahout), Redshift and PostgreSQL (for processing by any SQL-compatible analytics package).
* There are minor differences between the structure of data in both formats. These relate to data structures that Hive and PostgreSQL support (e.g. JSONs) that Redshift does not
* Nevertheless, the structure of both is similar: representing a fat table
* Going forwards our intention is to move the storage format for data on S3 from the current flatfile structure to Avro. **This** will become the 'canonical Snowplow data structure'. Other formats (e.g. Redshift, PostgreSQL etc.) will simply be 'flattened' versions of the same data. We have outlined some of our plans in [this blog post][avro-blog-post].

<a name="customcontexts" />
#### 2.3.7 Contexts

Contexts enable Snowplow users to define their own entities that are related to events, and fields that are related to each of those entities. For example, an online retailer may choose to define a `user` context, to store information about a particular user, which might include data points like the users Facebook ID, age, membership details etc. In addition, they may also define a `product` context, with product data e.g. SKU, name, created date, description, tags etc. 

An event can have any number of custom contexts attached. Each context is passed into Snowplow as a JSON. Additionally, the Snowplow Enrichment process can derive additional contexts.

The arrays of contexts JSONs related to an event are loaded directly into the `atomic.events` table as described below:

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description** | **Reqd?** | **Impl?** | **Example**    |
|:----------------|:---------|:----------------|:----------|:----------|:---------------|
| `contexts`   | array     | Contexts attached to event by Tracker | No     | Yes       | [{"schema":"iglu:com.acme/page_type/jsonschema/1-0-0", "data":{"type":"test"}}] |
| `derived_contexts` | array     | Contexts attached to event by Enrich | No     | Yes       | [{"schema":"iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/ua_parser_context/jsonschema/1-0-0", "data":{"deviceFamily":"Windows"}}] |

In addition, for users running on Redshift, Snowplow will shred each context JSON into a dedicated table in the `atomic` schema, making it much more efficient for analysts to query data passed in in any one of the contexts. Those contexts can be joined back to the core `atomic.events` table on `atomic.my_custom_context_table.root_id = atomic.events.event_id`, which is a one-to-one join.
