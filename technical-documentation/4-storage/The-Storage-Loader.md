## An overview of how the StorageLoader instruments the loading of data from S3 into Redshift

[[/technical-documentation/images/storage-loader-steps.png]]

* Data from enriched Snowplow event files generated by the Scalding process on EMR is read adn written to Amazon Redshift
* The enriched event files are then moved from teh in-bucket (which *was* the archive bucket for the EmrEtlRunner) to the archive bucket (for the StorageLoader)

The StorageLoader is configured via its [config file][config-file]. For more information, see the guide to [setting up the StorageLoader][storage-loader-setup].
