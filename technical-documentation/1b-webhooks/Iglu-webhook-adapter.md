## 1. Overview

This webhook adapter lets you track events sent via a `GET` request containing an [Iglu] [iglu]-compatible event payload.

You can use this adapter with vendors who allow you define your own event types for "postback". An example of a vendor who does this is [AD-X Tracking] [adxtracking-website].

## 2. Implementation

<a name="source" />
### 2.1 Event source

This adapter assumes that events are sent via a `GET` request with all information on the querystring.

The querystring's name-value pairs **must** include a `schema` parameter, which is set to a valid Iglu self-describing schema URI, such as:

```
iglu:com.acme.postbacks/install_error/jsonschema/1-0-0
```

<a name="example" />
### 2.2 Example

Here is an example of an Iglu-compatible event sent as a `GET` request:

```
http://snplow.acme.com/com.snowplowanalytics.iglu/v1?schema=iglu%3Acom.acme%2Fcampaign%2Fjsonschema%2F1-0-0
  &user=6353af9b-e288-4cf3-9f1c-b377a9c84dac&name=download&publisher_name=Organic&source=&tracking_id=&ad_unit=
```

This will be converted by the Iglu webhook adapter into a self-describing JSON looking like this:

```json
{
  "schema":"iglu:com.acme/campaign/jsonschema/1-0-0",
  "data": {
    "name":"download",
    "source":null,
    "ad_unit":null,
    "tracking_id":null,
    "publisher_name":"Organic",
    "user":"6353af9b-e288-4cf3-9f1c-b377a9c84dac"
}
```

Note that successful processing through into Amazon Redshift will depend on the appropriate JSON Schema, JSON Paths file and Redshift table definition all being defined correctly.

### 2.3 Snowplow adapter

Implementation: [IgluAdapter] [iglu-adapter]

Iglu webhook support was implemented in [Snowplow 0.9.11] [snowplow-0.9.11].

<a name="events" />
## 3. Events

This webhook adapter supports any event, as long as it is a valid [Iglu] [iglu] self-describing event.

Note that a limitation of this adapter is that all event properties will end up being "stringly typed" - the adapter has no way of knowing which parameters should be converted into numbers, booleans, date-times or similar.
