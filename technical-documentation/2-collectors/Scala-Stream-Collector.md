## Introduction

The Scala Stream Collector is a Snowplow event collector for [Snowplow][snowplow], written in Scala.
The Scala Stream Collector allows near-real time processing (Enrichment, Storage, Analytics) of a
Snowplow raw event stream.

The Scala Stream Collector receives raw Snowplow events over HTTP, serializes them to a
[Thrift][thrift] record format, and then writes them to a sink. Currently supported sinks are:

1. [Amazon Kinesis][kinesis]
2. [Apache Kafka][kafka]
3. `stdout` for a custom stream collection process

Like the Clojure Collector, the Scala Stream Collector supports cross-domain Snowplow deployments,
setting a `user_id` (used to identify unique visitors) server side to reliably identify the same
user across domains.

## How it works

### User identification

The Scala Stream Collector allows the use of a third-party cookie, making user tracking across
domains possible. The CloudFront Collector does not support cross domain tracking of users because
user ids are set client-side, whereas the Scala Stream Collector sets them server-side.

In a nutshell: the Scala Stream Collector receives events from a tracker, sets/updates a third-party
user tracking cookie, and returns the pixel to the client. The ID in this third-party user tracking
cookie is stored in the `network_userid` field in Snowplow events.

In pseudocode terms:

    if (request contains an "sp" cookie) {
        Record that cookie as the user identifier
        Set that cookie with a now+1 year cookie expiry
        Add the headers and payload to the output array
    } else {
        Set the "sp" cookie with a now+1 year cookie expiry
        Add the headers and payload to the output array
    }

## Technical architecture

The Scala Stream Collector is built on top of [akka-http][akka-http].
