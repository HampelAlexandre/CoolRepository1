## Introduction

SnowPlow is a powerful web analytics platform. It does three things:

1. Identifies users on your website(s), and tracks the way they engage. (Page views and events)
2. It stores the granular, customer-level, event-level data in a scalable "clickstream" datawarehouse. (Using Amazon S3.)
3. It enables data scientists and business analysts to query that data using powerful, scalable big data tools including Apache Hive, Pig and Hadoop (via Amazon EMR).
