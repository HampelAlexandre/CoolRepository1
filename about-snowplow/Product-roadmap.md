## Overview

The current release of Snowplow is **Release 86 Petra**. The planned roadmap for Snowplow is divided in two:

1. **Short term: a series of planned point releases** - adding specific, mostly incremental features, tweaks and bug fixes to the core platform
2. **Longer term: an approximate schedule for new components and capabilities** - setting out priorities and approximate timings for all-new Snowplow components and other ambitious new developments

We discuss each of these in turn below.

## Short-term: planned releases

You'll find the full list of milestones we are considering here:

For upcoming releases, look in that list for milestones whose names start with "Rxx", indicating that this milestone represents an upcoming release.

## Longer-term: approximate schedule

In this section we set out an approximate map of the new components and capabilities we want to add to Snowplow, segmented by sub-system and by time (aka priority).

**Update** this section has been removed because it was not current.
