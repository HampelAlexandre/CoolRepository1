The images in this folder are meant to be used in Pencil Project, http://pencil.evolus.vn/, and are integral part of batch_pipeline_steps.ep file in parent folder. The batch_pipeline_steps.png file is a PNG output of Pencil Project's file batch_pipeline_steps.ep. 

Do not either move or remove!

.ep file is in fact an XML file. If on loading of Pencil application you receive a notification that images could not be found/loaded, ensure the relative paths to the images are valid.

Note: Windows PC was used to produce batch_pipeline_steps.ep. On `git add`, the following warning was displayed:
   | "Warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in images/batch_pipeline_steps.ep.
   | The file will have its original line endings in your working directory."
Hopefully, it will have no affect when checking out the file to be used on both Windows PC or Mac.
