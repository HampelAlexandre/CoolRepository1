## Overview

The [Snowplow Analytics SDK for Scala](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-scala-analytics-sdk) lets you work with [Snowplow enriched events](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/canonical-event-model) in your Scala event processing, 
data modeling and machine-learning jobs. You can use this SDK with [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/), [Scalding](https://github.com/twitter/scalding), [Apache Samza](http://samza.apache.org/) and other JVM-compatible data processing frameworks.

The Scala Analytics SDK makes it significantly easier to build applications that consume Snowplow enriched data directly from Kinesis or S3.
