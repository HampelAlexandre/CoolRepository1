|:-----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|
| [Javascript tracker](javascript-tracker-setup) | A client-side Javascript tracker fo web browser use | Production-ready |
| [iOS tracker](ios-tracker-setup)               | An iOS tracker for iPhone / iPad application tracking | Pre-alpha      |

Currently, only one SnowPlow tracker is production ready: the SnowPlow [Javascript tracker](javascript-tracker-setup). This is ideal for tracking user behaviour across websites, and functions in much the same way as equivalent Javascript trackers for other web analytics products including Google Analytics and Omniture.

## Trackers on the SnowPlow roadmap.

As well as the iOS tracker in development, Android and Windows 7 trackers are on our product roadmap. If you are interested in working with us to develop them, [[talk to us]] and refer to the [[SnowPlow Tracker Protocol]] for technical specifications.
