This setup guide is divided into two sections:

1. [Setting up QuBit OpenTag](#setup-opentag)
2. [Integrating SnowPlow Javascript tracking tags with OpenTag](#snowplow-setup)

## 1. Setting up QuBit OpenTag

The following steps are required to setup OpenTag on your website:

1. [Create an OpenTag account](#create-account)
2. [Expose the data required by OpenTag and SnowPlow to OpenTag via the OpenTag Universal Variable](#expose-data)
3. [Integrate the container tag on your website](#container)

The steps are reasonably straight forward, especially for anyone familiar with tag management or Open Tag in particular. The only step with some elements that deviate from common setup instructions (e.g. provided by OpenTag) is exposing event data to OpenTag to drive SnowPlow custom event tracking. This is covered in step 2.
