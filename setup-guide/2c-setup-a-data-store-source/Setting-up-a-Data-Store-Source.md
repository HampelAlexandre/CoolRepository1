Snowplow allows you to collect events from various 3rd party data store sources. Currently we provide support for AWS Lambda only but more sources will be added later on.

## Choose and configure a Data Store Source

The following Data Store Sources are currently available for setup:

| **Data Store Source** (click for setup) | **Description**                                                                          | **Status** |
|:---|:---|:---|
