## Overview of the Clojure Collector

The Clojure collector has been designed to enable cross-domain SnowPlow deployments. As such, the Clojure collector performs one key function not performed by the [Cloudfront collector](setting up the cloudfront collector): it sets the user ID (used to identify unique visitors) server side, so that it is possible to reliably identify the same user across domains. This differs from the [Cloudfront collector](setting up the cloudfront collector), where user IDs are set on the client side.

The Clojure collector has been designed to run on [Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk][eb]. This provides two key advantages:

1. It makes it easy to deploy the Clojure collector in a scalable way
2. It makes use of Elastic Beanstalk's built in support for saving Tomcat logs into S3. These are the logs that are processed by the at the [ETL](choosing an etl module) stage to generate SnowPlow event data.

## Contents

Setting up the Clojure collector is a X step process:

1. [Download the Clojoure collector WAR file, or compile it from source](#war-file). (Required)
2. [Create a new application in Elastic Beanstalk, and upload the WAR file into it] (#create-eb-app). (Required)
3. [Configure the application environment, including switching on logging to S3] (#env-config). (Required)
4. Enable support for HTTPS. (Optional, but recommended.)
5. Set your tracker to point at the Clojure collector end point. (Required)
6. Update the EmrEtlRunner configuration YAML file

## 1. Download the Clojoure collector `WAR` file, or compile it from source

You can download the WAR file directly from Github [here][github-download] or from S3 [here][s3-download].

Alternatively, you can build it from the source files. To do so, you will need [Leiningen][leiningen] installed. 

To do so, download the SnowPlow repo:

	$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow.git

Navigate into the clojure collector folder:

	$ cd 2-collectors/clojure-collector

Download the required dependencies:

	$ lein deps

And then build the `war` file:

	$ lein ring uberwar

The `war` file will be saved in the `target` subdirectory.

We now need to add a couple of files to the `war`, that were not included as part of the `lein ring uberwar` command above. These files customize the format of the log files generated so that they include all the relevant data points (in particular, the `user_id`), and ensure that the log files have the same format as those generated by the [Cloudfront collector](setting up the cloudfront collector). To add both files, first navigate into the `war-resources` directory:

	$ cd war-resources

Then execute the following two commands:

	$ jar uf ../target/clojure-collector-0.1.0-standalone.war .ebextensions/server.xml 
	$ jar uf ../target/clojure-collector-0.1.0-standalone.war .ebextensions/server-update.config

The `war` file is now ready to be deployed to Amazon Elastic Beanstalk.

## 2. Create a new application in Elastic Beanstalk, and upload the WAR file to it

Amazon makes it easy to create a new application in Elastic Beanstalk and upload your `war` file into it. All of this is possible via the web UI.

On your web browser, log into the [AWS control panel][aws]. From the **Services** dropdown menu select **Elastic Beanstalk**. 

Before you create your application, you need to switch to the region you want your web server located. Select your region from the dropdown on the top right of the screen:

[[/setup-guide/images/clojure-collector-setup-guide/0.png]]

Once you've selected your region, you're ready to create your application. Click on the **Create application** button (located on the top right of the screen, below the top menu bar with the region selection):

[[/setup-guide/images/clojure-collector-setup-guide/1.png]]

Give your application a suitable name and description. Select **32bit Amazon Linux running Tomcat 7** for the container type. For the **Application Source**, select **Upload your Existing Application**. Use the **Choose File** button to point Elastic Beanstalk at the `war` file from [part 1](#war-file).

[[/setup-guide/images/clojure-collector-setup-guide/2.png]]

Next you need to configure the environment details. You can setup multiple environments for each application, but for our purposes one is enough.

Keep the **Launch a new environment running this application** checkbox checked (i.e. selected), but **deselect** the 2nd option: **Create an RDS DB Instance with this environment**. We do **not** need a database to run the collector.

Give your environment a suitable name, URL and description:

[[/setup-guide/images/clojure-collector-setup-guide/3.png]]

Next we need to specify another set of configuration details. Set a suitable instance type (we recommend at least `m1.small`). If you have an EC2 key pair configured, you can enter the key pair name at this stage: this will enable you to use the key pair to SSH in should you wish. (This is not required, and can be added later without any difficulty.)

For the **Application Health Check URL** enter `/healthcheck`:

[[/setup-guide/images/clojure-collector-setup-guide/4.png]]

Click **Continue**. Amazon gives you the chance to review your inputs. When you've checked them click **Finish**. 

Amazon then sets up your the application and environment. When this is complete, you should see a screen like the one below. Note the green box, and the **Successflly running version First Release** notice.

[[/setup-guide/images/clojure-collector-setup-guide/5.png]]

To test that all is working as expected, select the **Environment Details** dropdown:

[[/setup-guide/images/clojure-collector-setup-guide/7.png]]

Click on the **URL** link. (This is [[http://cc-endpoint.elasticbeanstalk.com]] in the example above.) This should return a 404. If you add `/i' to the path (e.g. `http://cc-endpoint.elasticbeanstalk.com/i`), right click on the window and select **Inspect Element** in Chrome or **Inspect with Firebug** in Firefox, you should be able to see if the cookie has been set:

## 3. Configure your application environment

### 3a. Required change: enabling log file rotation to S3

Now that your application is up and running, you need to update the configuration so that the Tomcat logs are pushed to S3. (These will be processed by the [etl][etl] step to generate your SnowPlow data.)Click on the **Actions button** and select **Edit/Load configuration**.

[[/setup-guide/images/clojure-collector-setup-guide/6.png]]

Select the **Container** tab in the dialogue box, and then check the box marked **Enable log file rotation to Amazon S3**:

[[/setup-guide/images/clojure-collector-setup-guide/9.png]]

Click the **Apply changes** button. The environment update will be processed, and the collector app should be live again after a few minutes.

### 3b. Additional (optional) configuration options

There are a number of other environment configuration parameters that you may want to consider tailoring to your specific needs. All of them can be accessed via the **Edit Configuration** dialogue box.

<a name="3bi" ></a>

#### 3b i. Setting the environment to develop or production

You can set an environment mode in the collector e.g. to "Development" or "Production". This can be set via the Elastic Beanstalk UI. Simply select **Edit configuration**, select the **Conatainer** tab and scroll down. Enter your desired environment name in **Param1** and then select **Apply Changes**:

[[/setup-guide/images/clojure-collector-setup-guide/10.png]]

<a name="3bii" ></a>

#### 3b ii. Setting the P3P policy header

This can be entered directly into the same dialogue box as the environment name (see [3b i](#3bi) above), but in **Param2** rather than **Param1**.

<a name="3biii" ></a>

#### 3b iii. Setting the domain name

The domain name can be entered directly into the same dialogue box as the [environment name](#3bi) and [P3P policy header](#3bii) by entering it into **Param3**

If no value is added, the domain  name defaults to the collector domain name.

<a name="3biv" ></a>

#### 3b iv. Setting the cookie duration

This can be entered into the same dialogue box as the [environment name](#3bi), [P3P policy header](#3bii) and [domain name](#3biii), by entering the value in **Param4**. 

If no value is provided, cookies set default to expiring after one year.

#### 3b v. Auto scaling

Elastic Beanstalk can scale up the number of webservers running the collector to handle spikes in traffic.

Basic settings (minimum and maximum numbers of servers) can be set in the configuration dialogue box, under the **Auto Scaling** tab. 

[[/setup-guide/images/clojure-collector-setup-guide/11.png]]

You can tell Amazon in what circumstances to launch new instances by setting 'triggers'. More details on tuning Elastic Beanstalk can be found [here](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.managing.as.html).
