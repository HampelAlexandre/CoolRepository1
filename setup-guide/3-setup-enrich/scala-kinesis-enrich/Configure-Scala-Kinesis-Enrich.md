This documentation is for version 0.3.0 of Scala Kinesis Enrich. Documentation for other versions is available:

**[Version 0.1.0][v0.1]**

The Scala Stream Collector has a number of configuration options available.

## Basic configuration

### Template

Download a template configuration file from GitHub: [config.hocon.sample] [app-conf].

Now open the `config.hocon.sample` file in your editor of choice.

### AWS settings

Values that must be configured are:

+ `enrich.aws.access-key`
+ `enrich.aws.secret-key`

You can insert your actual credentials in these fields. Alternatively, if you set both fields to "env", your credentials will be taken from the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

### Source

The `enrich.source` setting determines which of the supported sources to read raw Snowplow events from:

+ `"kinesis`" for reading Thrift-serialized records from a named Amazon Kinesis stream
+ `"stdin`" for reading Base64-encoded Thrift-serialized records from the app's own `stdin` I/O stream

If you select `"kinesis"`, you need to set `enrich.streams.in` to the name of your raw Snowplow event stream [configured in your Scala Stream Collector](Configure-the-Scala-Stream-Collector).

### Sinks

The `enrich.sink` setting determines which of the supported sinks to write enriched Snowplow events to:

+ `"kinesis"` for writing enriched Snowplow events to a named Amazon Kinesis stream
+ `"stdouterr"` for writing enriched Snowplow events records to the app's own `stdout` I/O stream

If you select `"kinesis"`, you will also need to update the `enrich.streams.out` section:

```
out: {
  enriched: "SnowplowEnriched"
  enriched_shards: 1 # Number of shards to use if created.
  bad: "SnowplowBad" # Not used until #463
  bad_shards: 1 # Number of shards to use if created.
}
```

## Configuring enrichments

You may wish to use Snowplow's configurable enrichments. To do this, create a directory of enrichment JSONs. For each configurable enrichment you wish to use, the enrichments directory should contain a .json file with a configuration JSON for that enrichment. When you come to run Scala Kinesis Enrich you can then pass in the filepath to this directory using the --enrichments option.

Sensible default configuration enrichments are available on GitHub: [3-enrich/emr-etl-runner/config/enrichments][enrichment-json-examples].

See the documentation on [configuring enrichments][configuring-enrichments] for details on the available enrichments.

### GeoLiteCity databases

For the `ip_lookups` enrichment you can manually download the latest version of the [MaxMind GeoLiteCity database][geolite] jarfile directly from our Hosted Assets bucket on Amazon S3 - please see our [[Hosted assets]] page for details.

If you do not have the databases downloaded prior to running but still have the `ip_lookups` enrichment activated these databases will be downloaded automatically and loaded into the working directory.

Next: [[Run Scala Kinesis Enrich]]
