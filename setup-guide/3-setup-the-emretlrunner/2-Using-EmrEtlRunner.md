## 1. Overview

There are two usage modes for EmrEtlRunner:

1. **Rolling mode** where EmrEtlRunner processes whatever raw SnowPlow
   event logs it finds in the In Bucket
2. **Timespan mode** where EmrEtlRunner only processes those raw
   SnowPlow event logs whose timestamp is within a timespan specified
   on the command-line

Timespan mode can be useful if you have a large backlog of raw SnowPlow
event logs and you want to start by processing just a small subset of
those logs.

## 2. Command-line options

Invoke EmrEtlRunner using Bundler's `bundle exec` syntax:

    $ bundle exec bin/snowplow-emr-etl-runner
    
Note the `bin/` sub-folder, and that the `bundle exec` command will
only work when you are inside the `emr-etl-runner` folder.

The command-line options for EmrEtlRunner look like this:

    Usage: snowplow-emr-etl-runner [options]

    Specific options:
        -c, --config CONFIG              configuration file
        -s, --start YYYY-MM-DD           optional start date *
        -e, --end YYYY-MM-DD             optional end date *
        -s, --skip staging,emr,archive   skip work step(s)
        -b, --process-bucket BUCKET      run emr only on specified bucket. Implies --skip staging,archive

    * filters the raw event logs processed by EmrEtlRunner by their timestamp

    Common options:
        -h, --help                       Show this message
        -v, --version                    Show version

A note on the `--skip` option: this takes a list of individual steps to skip.
So for example you could run **only** the Hive job with the command-line option:

    $ bundle exec snowplow-emr-etl-runner --skip staging,archive --config ./config.yml

## 3. Running in each mode

### 3.1 Rolling mode

Invoking EmrEtlRunner with just the `--config` option puts it into rolling
mode, processing all the raw SnowPlow event logs it can find in your In
Bucket:

    $ bundle exec bin/snowplow-emr-etl-runner --config my-config.yml

### 3.2 Timespan mode

To run EmrEtlRunner in timespan mode, you need to specify the `--start`
and/or `--end` dates as well as the `--config` option, like so:

    $ bundle exec bin/snowplow-emr-etl-runner \
      --config my-config.yml \
      --start 2012-06-20 \
      --end 2012-06-24 

This will run EmrEtlRunner on log files which have timestamps in the period
20 June 2012 to 24 June 2012 inclusive.

Note that you do not have to specify both the start and end dates:

1. Specify `--start` only and the timespan will run from your start date
   up to today, inclusive
2. Specify `--end` only and the timespan will run from the beginning of
   time up to your end date, inclusive

If your raw SnowPlow logs are generated by the Amazon CloudFront collector,
please note that CloudFront timestamps in **UTC**.

## 4. Next steps

Comfortable using EmrEtlRunner? Then [schedule it] [schedule] so that it regularly takes new data generated by the collector, processes it, cleans it, enriches it, and writes it back to S3.
