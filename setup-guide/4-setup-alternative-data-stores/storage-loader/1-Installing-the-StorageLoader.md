## 1. Assumptions

This guide assumes that you have administrator access to a Unix-based server (e.g. Ubuntu, OS X, Fedora) which you can install StorageLoader on.

You might wish to try out the [steps](Setting-up-EC2-instance-for-EmrEtlRunner-and-StorageLoader) showing you how an EC2 instance could be set up via [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

## 2. Dependencies

### 2.1 Software

The StorageLoader requires Java 7+ to run.

Make sure that if you are loading Snowplow events into a PostgreSQL database, then the StorageLoader **must be run on the same server running PostgreSQL**. That is because it downloads the files locally, and Postgres needs to be able to ingest the data from the local file system.

### 2.2 S3 buckets

StorageLoader moves the Snowplow event files through three distinct S3 buckets during
the load process. These buckets are as follows:

1. **In Bucket** - contains the Snowplow event files to process
2. **Archive Bucket** - where StorageLower moves the Snowplow
   event files after successful loading

The In Bucket for StorageLoader is the same as the Out Bucket for the EmrEtlRunner -
i.e. you will already have setup this bucket.

We recommend creating a new folder for the Archive Bucket - i.e. do **not** re-use
EmrEtlRunner's own Archive Bucket. Create the required Archive Bucket in the same
AWS region as your In Bucket.

Right, now we can install StorageLoader.

## 3. Installation

We host StorageLoader on the distribution platform [JFrog Bintray](https://bintray.com/). If you completed [EmrEtlRunner installation](1-Installing-EmrEtlRunner) then this step could be skipped. Otherwise you can get a copy of the StorageLoader as shown below.

**Note**: Please, follow [this link](http://dl.bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/) if you wish to get a different version of the loader. The distribution name follows the pattern `snowplow_emr_{{RELEASE_VERSION}}.zip`.

```sh
$ wget http://dl.bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/snowplow_emr_r77_great_auk.zip
```

The archive contains both [EmrEtlRunner](1-Installing-EmrEtlRunner) and StorageLoader. Unzip the archive:

```sh
$ unzip snowplow_emr_r77_great_auk.zip
```

You will see two files `snowplow-emr-etl-runner` and `snowplow-storage-loader` where the second one is the actual StorageLoader.

## 4. Configuration

StorageLoader requires a YAML format configuration file to run. This should be the same file you use to configure the EmrEtlRunner. See [[Common configuration]] more information on its format.

All done? You have the StorageLoader installed! Now find out [how to use it](2-using-the-storageloader).
