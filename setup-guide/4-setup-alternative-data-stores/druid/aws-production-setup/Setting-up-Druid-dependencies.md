The prerequisites for a production setup of Druid in AWS are as follows:

1. [Amazon S3] [amazon-s3] to act as the data repository for Druid ("deep storage")
2. [Postgres on Amazon RDS] [pg-rds] to act as the metadata storage for Druid
3. [Apache ZooKeeper] [zookeeper] to coordinate the Druid clusters

Let's configure/install each of these in turn.

### 1. Amazon S3

We will use [Amazon S3] [amazon-s3] as the data repository for Druid ("deep storage").

### 2. Postgres on Amazon RDS

We will use a PostgreSQL instance running on Amazon RDS as the medata storage for Druid.

### 3. Apache ZooKeeper

We will use Apache ZooKeeper as the cluster coordination service for Druid.

**Setting up and running a production ZooKeeper cluster is out of the scope of this documentation. We strongly recommend reading [ZooKeeper (O'Reilly)] [zookeeper-oreilly] before proceeding.**

Create a ZooKeeper cluster on EC2, with an **odd** number of nodes, at least 3. You should **not** attempt to run any other Druid components on these ZooKeeper nodes.
