We support loading Snowplow events into [Druid] [druid] as part of the Snowplow Kinesis pipeline.

We have two setup guides for working with Druid:

1. [**Single-instance setup guide**](Setting-up-Druid-single-instance) for getting a local version of Druid working with Snowplow. Useful for development and testing
2. [**AWS production setup guide**](Setting-up-Druid-for-production) for getting a horizontally-scaleable, distributed installation of Druid working with a production Snowplow Kinesis pipeline in AWS

Both guides assume that you are using **Druid 0.8.3 Stable** - this is the version that we have tested these instructions with.

TODO: move the below into the instance spec description
