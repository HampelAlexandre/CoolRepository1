This guide takes you through the process for integrating SnowPlow's JavaScript tracker into your website or web app.

## Before you get started...

The following guide covers the process for integrating SnowPlow tracking tags directly onto your website. We recommend integrating SnowPlow via a Tag Management solution. If you wish to integrate SnowPlow tags using a tag management platform, we have provided separate guides for:

* [Google Tag Manager](integrating-javascript-tags-with-google-tag-manager)
* [Qubit's OpenTag](integrating-javascript-tags-with-qubit-opentag)

We recommend using the SnowPlow asyncronous tags. Doing so means that the loading of the SnowPlow tags will not cause site content to load more slowly, thereby providing a better experience for your users.

## 1. Asynchronous integration

### 1.1 Installing the header script

To use `snowplow.js` in an 'async' manner, first add the following script into your website template's `<head>` section:

```html
<!-- SnowPlow starts plowing -->
<script type="text/javascript">
var _snaq = _snaq || [];

_snaq.push(['setCollectorCf', '{{CLOUDFRONT DOMAIN}}']);
_snaq.push(['trackPageView']);
_snaq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);

(function() {
var sp = document.createElement('script'); sp.type = 'text/javascript'; sp.async = true; sp.defer = true;
sp.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https' : 'http') + '://d1fc8wv8zag5ca.cloudfront.net/0.9.1/sp.js';
var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(sp, s);
})();
 </script>
<!-- SnowPlow stops plowing -->
```

#### 1.2 Configuring the header script: setting the Collector endpoint

You need to set the collector endpoint in the header script: this ensures that any data generated by the Javascript Tracker is sent to the Collector your setup as part of the previous stage in the setup process.

If you are using the [Cloudfront Collector](Setting up the Cloudfront Collector), you do so using the following line:

```javascript
_snaq.push(['setCollectorCf', '{{CLOUDFRONT DOMAIN}}']);
```

Simply substitude your Cloudfront domain in for the {{CLOUDFROUNT DOMAIN}} e.g.

```javascript
_snaq.push(['setCollectorCf', 'd1x5tduoxffdr7']);
```

If you are using another Collector type (e.g. the [Clojure Collector](setting-up-the-clojure-collector)) you will need to use an alternative `setCollectorUrl` function rather than the `setCollectorCf` to set the Collector endpoint:

```javascript
_snaq.push(['setCollectorUrl', '{{COLLECTOR ENDPOINT HERE}}']);
```

For example, if your collector is at `c.snplow.com` then your tag would contain the line:

```javascript
_snaq.push(['setCollectorUrl', 'c.snplow.com']);
```

#### 1.3 Configuring the header script: updating the reference to `sp.js`

The reference to `'://d1fc8wv8zag5ca.cloudfront.net/0.9.1/sp.js'` loads `sp.js`, the SnowPlow Javascript tracker. The version loaded is the version [hosted by the SnowPlow team from our own Cloudfront subdomain](hosted-assets) (and provided free to the community). 

If you wish to host the SnowPlow JavaScript file yourself (see the guide to [[Self-hosting snowplow.js|Self hosting snowplow js]]), then you need to update the tag above, swapping your own Cloudfront `{{SUBDOMAIN}}` (the one from which you serve `sp.js` in for ours:

```javascript
sp.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https' : 'http') + '://{{SUBDOMAIN}}.cloudfront.net/sp.js';
```

<a name="sync"/>
## 2. Synchronous integration

### 2.1 Installing the header script

To use `snowplow.js` in a 'sync' manner, first add the following script into your website template's `<head>` section:

```html
<!-- SnowPlow starts plowing -->
<script type="text/javascript">
var spSrc = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https' : 'http') + '://d1fc8wv8zag5ca.cloudfront.net/0.9.1/sp.js';
document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='" + spSrc + "' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
try {
var snowplowTracker = SnowPlow.getTrackerCf('{{CLOUDFRONT DOMAIN}}');
snowplowTracker.trackPageView();
snowplowTracker.enableLinkTracking();
} catch ( err ) {}
</script>
<!-- SnowPlow stops plowing -->
```

### 2.2 Configuring the header script: setting your collector endpoint

You need to set the collector endpoint in the header script: this ensures that any data generated by the Javascript Tracker is sent to the Collector your setup as part of the previous stage in the setup process.

If you are using the [Cloudfront Collector](setting-up-the-cloudfront-collector)) you will need to do so using the following line:

```javascript
var snowplowTracker = SnowPlow.getTrackerCf('{{CLOUDFRONT DOMAIN}}');
```

Simply substitude your Cloudfront domain in for the {{CLOUDFROUNT DOMAIN}} e.g.

```javascript
var snowplowTracker = SnowPlow.getTrackerCf('d1x5tduoxffdr7');
```

If you are using another Collector type (e.g. the [Clojure Collector](setting-up-the-clojure-collector)) you will need to use an alternative `setCollectorUrl` function rather than the `setCollectorCf` to set the Collector endpoint:

```javascript
var snowplowTracker = SnowPlow.getTrackerUrl('{{COLLECTOR URL}}');
```

For example, if your collector is at `c.snplow.com` then your tag would contain the line:

```javascript
var snowplowTracker = SnowPlow.getTrackerUrl('c.snplow.com');
```

### 2.3 Configuring the header script: updating the reference to `sp.js`

The reference to `'://d1fc8wv8zag5ca.cloudfront.net/0.9.1/sp.js'` loads `sp.js`, the SnowPlwo Javascript tracker. The version loaded is the version [hosted by the SnowPlow team from our own Cloudfront subdomain](hosted-assets) (and provided free to the community). 

If you wish to host the SnowPlow JavaScript file yourself (see the guide to [[Self-hosting snowplow.js|Self hosting snowplow js]]), then you need to update the tag above, swapping your own Cloudfront `{{SUBDOMAIN}}` (the one from which you serve `sp.js` in for ours:

```javascript
sp.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https' : 'http') + '://{{SUBDOMAIN}}.cloudfront.net/sp.js';
```

## 3. Tracking more than just page views: event tracking, ecommerce tracking etc.

SnowPlow has been built to track more than simply page views. We believe, as far as possible, that *every* every that can happen on a user journey should be captured in SnowPlow, and that includes every in-page events that might not result in a new page load. (Which are the only events that are captured as by the page view tracking already implemented.) The Javascript tracker incorporates a number of functions to capture a wealth of events including:

1. [Online transactions](javascript-tracker#wiki-ecommerce)
2. [Ad impressions] (javascript-tracker#wiki-adimps)
3. [Social events] (javascript-tracker#social-events) (e.g. *liking* a post)
4. Item views (e.g. views of specific products, articles)
5. [Custom events] (javascript-tracker#wiki-events) (i.e. AJAX events that are not included in the above list) e.g. adding an item to basket or pausing a video

Detailed documentation on how to capture the complete range of events possible with SnowPlow can be found in the [[Javascript Tracker]] section of the [Technical Documentation] (snowplow-technical-docuemntation).

## Testing the integration

_This section is common to both the synchronous and asynchronous integration approaches._

### Checking snowplow.js is working

You can 'kick the tyres' of `snowplow.js` with the example HTML pages available in [https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/1-trackers/javascript-tracker/examples/web](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/1-trackers/javascript-tracker/examples/web) 

    snowplow/tracker/examples

Before running these HTML pages, you will make sure to update the `{{CLOUDFRONT DOMAIN}}` to your SnowPlow-supplied Cloudfront domain; if you are using a self-hosted `snowplow.js`, then update that in the HTML files too.

We recommend using Chrome's [Developer Tools] [chrome-dev-tools] or [Firebug] [firebug] for Firefox to check that SnowPlow's JavaScript tracking is working correctly. Here is what Chrome's Network panel looks like after loading the page and clicking each button once:

![network-pane] [network-pane]

Note the three successful (status code 200) `GET`s to `i`. The first of these was triggered by the page load, and then there is one `GET` each for the two user actions (button clicks) that we're tracking. 
If you have any problems getting this to run, please [contact] [contact] the **SnowPlow Analytics** team.

## 5. Next steps

There are a number of optional additional steps associated with Tracker Setup:

* [Setup campaign tracking] (tracking-your-marketing-campaigns)
* [Host SnowPlow.js yourself] (self-hosting-snowplow-js)
* [Modify / hack on SnowPlow.js] (modifying-snowplow-js)

Once you have completed the Tracker setup, you will be successfully logging customer-level and event-level data to S3. Now you are ready to [Setup EmrEtlRunner] (Setting-up-SnowPlow#wiki-step3), which will regularly take that data, clean it up and enrich it, so that you can analyse it.
