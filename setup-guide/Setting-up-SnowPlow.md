## An overview of the setup process

Before setting up SnowPlow, it is helpful to understand the steps involved, and what is accomplished at each step:

### 1. Setup a SnowPlow collector

The SnowPlow collector receives data from SnowPlow trackers and logs that data to S3 for storage and further processing. Setting up a collector is the first step in the SnowPlow setup process, because without it you have no way of storing any data generated.

## 2. Setup a SnowPlow tracker

SnowPlow trackers generate event data and send that data to SnowPlow collectors to be captured. The most common SnowPlow tracker used is the Javascript tracker, which is integrated in websites (either directly or via a tag management solution) the same way that any web analytics tracker (e.g. Google Analytics or Omniture tags) is integrated.

**Note**: once you have setup a collector and tracker, you will successfully be capturing granular, event-level and customer-level data. **The remaining steps listed all helpl to make analysing that data easier. They can be taken sometime after you have setup your collector and tracker**, as you can use them to process weeks or even months of historical data.

## 3. Setup EmrEtlRunner to clean up and enrich the data from the collector.

The EmrEtlRunner application takes the raw log files generated by the SnowPlow collector and

1. Cleans up the data into a format that is easier to parse / analyse
2. Enriches that data. (E.g. infers the location of the visitor from his / her IP address and infers the search engine keywords from the query string)
3. Stores that cleaned, enriched data in S3 where it can be processed using Apache Hive / Hadoop / Mahout via EMR

Once you have setup the EmrEtlRunner application, data generated by the collector

## 4. Setup the StorageLoader to load the data into alternative data stores e.g. Infobright, Redshift, SkyDB

Most SnowPlow users store their web event data in at least two places: S3 for processing in Hadoop (e.g. to enable machine learning via Mahout) and a columnar database (e.g. Infobright or Redshift) for more traditional OLAP analysis.

The StorageLoader is an application to regularly transfer data from S3 into other databases e.g. Infobright. If you **only** wish to process your data using Hadoop on EMR, you do not need to setup the StorageLoader. However, if you do, then you will need to setup additional databases (e.g. Infobright) and setup the StorageLoader to regularly transfer data from S3 into your additional data stores.

## 5. Analyse your data!

Once your data is stored in S3 and Infobright, setup is complete and you are in a position to start analysing it. As part of the setup guide we run through the steps necessary to perform some intiial analysis and plugin a couple of analytics tools, to get you started.
