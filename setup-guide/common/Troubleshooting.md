This is a page of hints, tips and explanations to help you work with SnowPlow. If something looks like a bug in SnowPlow but isn't, it will end up on this page too.

### Why are browser features all recorded as null for Internet Explorer?

With the exceptions of cookies and Java, our JavaScript tracker cannot detect what browser features (PDF, Flash etc) a given instance of Internet Explorer has. This is because IE, unlike the other major browsers, does not populate the `window.navigator.mimeTypes[]` and `navigator.plugins[]` properties. There are other ways of detecting some browser features (via ActiveX), but these are not advised as they can trigger UAC warnings on Windows.

### Hive problem: I upgraded and now queries are not working or returning nonsense results

The most likely reason for this is that you have configured your ETL process to output your SnowPlow event files in the **non-Hive format** (used to feed Infobright etc). This is typically configured with the following configuration option to EmrEtlRunner:

```yaml
:etl:
    :storage_format: non-hive
```

Unlike the Hive format output, the non-Hive format output for SnowPlow event files is **not backwards compatible** for Hive queries. In other words, with the non-Hive format, running a HiveQL query across SnowPlow event files generated by two different versions of the ETL process will probably not work.

The solution is to re-run the ETL process across all of your raw SnowPlow logs when you upgrade your ETL process.
