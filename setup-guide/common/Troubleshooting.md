This is a page of hints, tips and explanations to help you work with SnowPlow. If something looks like a bug in SnowPlow but isn't, it will end up on this page too.

### Why are browser features all recorded as null for Internet Explorer?

With the exceptions of cookies and Java, our JavaScript tracker cannot detect what browser features (PDF, Flash etc) a given instance of Internet Explorer has. This is because IE, unlike the other major browsers, does not populate the `window.navigator.mimeTypes[]` and `navigator.plugins[]` properties. There are other ways of detecting some browser features (via ActiveX), but these are not advised as they can trigger UAC warnings on Windows.

### Hive problem: I upgraded and now queries are not working or returning nonsense results

The most likely reason for this is that you have configured your ETL process to output your SnowPlow event files in the **non-Hive format** (used to feed Infobright etc). This is typically configured with the following configuration option to EmrEtlRunner:

```yaml
:etl:
    :storage_format: non-hive
```

Unlike the Hive format output, the non-Hive format output for SnowPlow event files is **not backwards compatible** for Hive queries. In other words, with the non-Hive format, running a HiveQL query across SnowPlow event files generated by two different versions of the ETL process will probably not work.

The solution is to re-run the ETL process across all of your raw SnowPlow logs when you upgrade your ETL process.

###  I need to recreate my table of SnowPlow events, how?

If you have somehow lost or corrupted your SnowPlow event store (in Infobright or Redshift), don't panic! 

Fortunately, **SnowPlow does not delete any data at any stage of its processing**, so it's all available for you to restore from your archive buckets. 

Here is a simple workflow to use with StorageLoader to re-populate Infobright or Redshift with all of your events:

1. Create a new events table in your database, let's call it `events2`
2. Create a new S3 bucket, let's call it `events-archive2`
3. Edit your StorageLoader's `config.yml` file:
   * Change `:table:` to point to your `events2` table
   * Change `:in:` to point to your existing archive bucket
   * Change `:archive:` to point to your new `events-archive2` bucket
4. Rerun StorageLoader

This should load **all** of your events into your new `events2` table, archiving all events after loading into `events-archive2`.

###  I want to recompute my SnowPlow events, how?

You may well want to recompute all of your SnowPlow events, for example if we release a new enrichment (such as geo-IP lookup) and you want it to be run against all of your historical data.

Fortunately, **SnowPlow does not delete any data at any stage of its processing**, so the raw data is still available in your archive bucket for you to regenerate your SnowPlow events from. 

Here is a simple workflow to use with EmrEtlRunner to regenerate your SnowPlow events from your raw collector logs:

1. Create a new S3 bucket, let's call it `events2`
2. Create a new S3 bucket, let's call it `logs-archive2`
3. Edit your EmrEtlRunner's `config.yml` file:
   * Change `:in:` to point to your existing archive bucket
   * Change `:out:` to point to your new `events2` bucket
   * Change `:archive:` to point to your new `logs-archive2` bucket
4. Rerun EmrEtlRunner

This should load **recompute** all of your events into your new `events2` bucket, archiving all events after loading into `events-archive2`. From there you can reload your recomputed events into Infobright or Redshift using StorageLoader.
