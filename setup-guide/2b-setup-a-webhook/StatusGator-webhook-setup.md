## 1. Overview

This webhook integration lets you receive [StatusGator][statusgator-website] status change events.

For the technical implementation, see [[StatusGator webhook adapter]].

<a name="compat" />

### 1.1 Compatibility

* [R97 Knossos][r97]+ (`POST`-capable collectors only)
* [StatusGator webhook API][statusgator-webhooks]

<a name="setup" />

## 2. Setup

Integrating StatusGator's webhooks into Snowplow is a two-stage process:

1. Configure StatusGator to send events to Snowplow
2. (Optional) Create the StatusGator events tables into Amazon Redshift

## 2.1 StatusGator

First login to StatusGator and setup one or more of the cloud services you want to receive notifications from, by clicking them and setting **Subscribe** to "ON", as in this example for the Amazon Web Services notifications:

[[/setup-guide/images/webhooks/statusgator/statusgator-1.png]]

Once you have selected your cloud providers, click on *Notifications** on the top panel and set **Webhooks** to "ON" and then add the webhook URL for your collector in the field **Web Hook URL**, like so:

[[/setup-guide/images/webhooks/statusgator/statusgator-2.png]]

* For the this field you will need to provide the URL to your Snowplow Collector.  We use a special path to tell Snowplow that these events are generated by StatusGator:

```
http://<collector host>/com.statusgator/v1
```

If you want, you can also manually override the event's `platform` parameter like so:

```
http://<collector host>/com.statusgator/v1?p=<platform code>
```

Supported platform codes can again be found in the [Snowplow Tracker Protocol][tracker-protocol]; if not set, then the value for `platform` will default to `srv` for a server-side application.

Once you click the **Save** button you are ready to receive events about the downtime on your chosen cloud providers.

## 2.2 Redshift

If you are running the Snowplow batch flow with Amazon Redshift, then you should deploy the relevent event tables into your Amazon Redshift.

You can find the table definition at [Iglu Central](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu-central/tree/master/sql/com.statusgator).

Make sure to deploy this table into the same schema as your `events` table.

That's it - with this table deployed, your StatusGator events should automatically flow through into Redshift.
