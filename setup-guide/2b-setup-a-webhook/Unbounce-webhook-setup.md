## 1. Overview

This webhook integration lets you receive [Unbounce][unbounce-website] form submit events.

For the technical implementation, see [[Unbounce webhook adapter]].

<a name="compat" />

### 1.1 Compatibility

* [R97 Knossos][r97]+ (`POST`-capable collectors only)
* [Unbounce webhook API][unbounce-webhooks]

<a name="setup" />

## 2. Setup

Integrating Unbounce's webhooks into Snowplow is a two-stage process:

1. Configure Unbounce to send events to Snowplow
2. (Optional) Create the Unbounce events tables into Amazon Redshift

<a name="setup-Unbounce" />

## 2.1 Unbounce

First login to Unbounce and click on the title the landing page for which you want to configure the webhook (in this example "Wayfaring"):

[[/setup-guide/images/webhooks/unbounce/unbounce-1.png]]

In the page configuration click **Webhooks**:

[[/setup-guide/images/webhooks/unbounce/unbounce-2.png]]

..and then click **Add Webhook**:

[[/setup-guide/images/webhooks/unbounce/unbounce-3.png]]

* For the this field you will need to provide the URL to your Snowplow Collector.  We use a special path to tell Snowplow that these events are generated by unbounce:

```
http://<collector host>/com.unbounce/v1
```

* Then select the **Send all transcripts automatically** and/or **Send offline messages** according to your needs (2). As of the time of writing (15.12.2017) no other events are directly supported so **do not tick Send all events**.

If you want, you can also manually override the event's `platform` parameter like so:

```
http://<collector host>/com.unbounce/v1?p=<platform code>
```

Supported platform codes can again be found in the [Snowplow Tracker Protocol][tracker-protocol]; if not set, then the value for `platform` will default to `srv` for a server-side application.

Once the URL has been configured click **Next**:

If you decide to **Configure Field Mapping** in the webhook dialog, configure only fields in **Unbounce Form Info** (1), not in **Unbounce Page Info** (2):

[[/setup-guide/images/webhooks/unbounce/unbounce-5.png]]

Once you click the **Done** button you are ready to receive events about your client chat interactions from Unbounce.

## 2.2 Redshift

If you are running the Snowplow batch flow with Amazon Redshift, then you should deploy the relevant event tables into your Amazon Redshift.

You can find the table definition here:

* [com_unbounce_form_post_1.sql][com_unbounce_form_post_1-sql]

Make sure to deploy this table into the same schema as your `events` table.

That's it - with this table deployed, your Mailgun events should automatically flow through into Redshift.
