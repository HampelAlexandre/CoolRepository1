## 1. Overview

This webhook integration lets you track application installation events logged by [AD-X Tracking] [adxtracking-website].

For the technical implementation, see [[AD-X Tracking webhook adapter]].

<a name="compat" />
### 1.1 Compatibility

* [Snowplow 0.9.10] [snowplow-0.9.10]+ (all collectors)
* AD-X Tracking webhook format as of 1 November 2014

<a name="setup" />
## 2. Setup

Integrating AD'X Tracking's webhooks into Snowplow is a two-stage process:

1. Configure AD-X Tracking to send events to Snowplow
2. (Optional) Create the AD-X Tracking event table into Amazon Redshift

## 2.1 AD-X Tracking

There is no UI in AD-X Tracking to specify the destination for your webhooks. Therefore, email your AD-X Tracking account manager and provide him or her with the URI to your Snowplow Collector. We use a special path to tell Snowplow that these events are generated by AD-X Tracking, thus:

```
http://<collector host>/com.adxtracking/v1?aid=<company code>
```

The `&aid=` name-value pair in your URI's querystring is optional; this is the `app_id` parameter taken from the [Snowplow Tracker Protocol] [tracker-protocol]. You can use it to specify which app these `app_install` events belong to.

If you want, you can also manually override the event's `platform` parameter like so:

```
http://<collector host>/com.adxtracking/v1?aid=<company code>&p=<platform code>
```

Supported platform codes can again be found in the [Snowplow Tracker Protocol] [tracker-protocol]; if not set, then the value for `platform` will default to `app` for a general-purpose application.

## 2.2 Redshift

If you are running the Snowplow batch (Hadoop) flow with Amazon Redshift, then you should deploy the `app_install` table into your Amazon Redshift.

You can find the table definition here:

* [com_adxtracking_app_install.sql] [app-install-sql]

Make sure to deploy this table into the same schema as your `events` table.

That's it - with this table deployed, your AD-X Tracking app install events should automatically flow through into Redshift.
