## 1. Overview

The [Snowplow Unity Tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-unity-tracker) lets you add analytics to your [Unity] [unity]-based desktop and mobile apps, servlets and games.

The Tracker should be relatively straightforward to setup if you are familiar with Unity and C# development.

Ready? Let's get started.

### 2.2 Dependencies

There are several dependencies that are required to use the Unity Tracker currently.  These are available in [this folder][deps-folder].

* `UnityEngine.dll` : This is included as a way of setting up development externally to the Unity playground; you do not need to include this.
* `UnityHTTP.dll` : This is the pre-built dll from [this library][unity-http-home].  This is a simplified version of [this library][unity-http].
* `UnityJSON.dll` : This is the pre-built dll from [this library][unity-json-home].

All the other dependencies are required for proper Tracker function.

### 3.1 Download

The Unity Tracker package is published to Snowplow's [bintray repository] [bintray-snplow].  Once downloaded simply add the `SnowplowTracker-0.1.0.unitypackage` to your project.  This should insert all of the required dll files into your `Assets/Plugins/` folder.

Done? Now read the [Unity Tracker API](Unity-Tracker) to start tracking events.
