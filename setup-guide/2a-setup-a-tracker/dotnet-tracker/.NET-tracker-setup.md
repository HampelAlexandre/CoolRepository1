## 1. Overvew

The [Snowplow .NET Tracker][dotnet-tracker-github] is written in C# and lets you add analytics to your [.NET][dotnet] applications.

<a name="compatibility" />

## 2. Tracker compatibility

Version 1.0.0+ marks the conversion of the core library to .NET Standard 1.4. This core (`Snowplow.Tracker`) is directly compatible with [these platforms][netstandard-matrix].
We have also published a Portable Class Library (PCL) wrapper providing extra features for Xamarin users. This is called `Snowplow.Tracker.PlatformExtensions`.
