## Communications channels

We want to make it super-easy for SnowPlow users and contributors to talk to us and also to each other, to share ideas, solve problems and help make SnowPlow awesome. Here are the main channels we're supporting currently, take your pick:

### Google Group

The [SnowPlow Google Group] [google-group] (aka `snowplow-user`) is a good first stop for a general enquiry about SnowPlow or a specific support issue (e.g. trouble setting SnowPlow up). It's also a good forum for discussions about the roadmap or potential new functionality - as it's more public than just opening a GitHub issue or sending us an email.

### Google+ Hangout

Our regular voice- and video-enabled Google Hangouts give us all a chance to meet face-to-face (albeit virtually!). We alternate running a "SnowPlow West" and a "SnowPlow East" Hangout - dial-in to whichever one works best for your timezone.

The next Hangouts are as follows:

#### SnowPlow West Hangout

_Date and time to come_

#### SnowPlow East Hangout 

_Date and time to come_

### GitHub

If you spot a bug, then by all means [raise an issue] [new-issue] in our [main GitHub project] [snowplow-repo] (`snowplow/snowplow`); likewise if you have developed a cool new feature or improvement in your SnowPlow fork, then by all means send us a pull request!

If you want to brainstorm a potential new feature, then the SnowPlow Google Group (see above) is probably a better place to start).

### Email

If you want to talk directly to us (e.g. about a commercially sensitive issue), email is the easiest way.
